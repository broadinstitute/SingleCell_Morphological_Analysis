    Given a numeric pd.DataFrame, this will find highly correlated features,
    and return a list of features to remove.
    Parameters
    -----------
    data : pandas DataFrame
        DataFrame
    threshold : float
        correlation threshold, will remove one of pairs of features with a
        correlation greater than this value.
    remove_negative: Boolean
        If true then features which are highly negatively correlated will
        also be returned for removal.
    Returns
    --------
